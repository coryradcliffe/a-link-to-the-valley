# a-link-to-the-valley

i need to write python code for a game that will have a combination of zelda adventuring and fighting based on an edo era japan samurai turned ronin after no one needed him and he bought a farm that you tend to in a far away village.  It will have elements of gameplay like stardew valley when it comes to taking care of your village and making money.  There will be rifts that open up and yokai spill out to fight and the ronin becomes the defacto town protector.  I have a sprite pack based loosely on zelda and here are the inputs for the various assets:

under folder assets\character ther is player.png (288x480 with the first 6 lines being 6 wide, next 3 lines 4 wide, and last line 3 wide) skeleton_swordless.png (288x624 with the first 9 lines being 6 wide, next 3 lines 4 wide, and last line 5 wide), skeleton.png (288x624 with the first 9 lines being 6 wide, next 3 lines 4 wide, and last line 5 wide), and slime.png (224x416 4 at 4, 3 at 6, 3 at 7, 3 at 3 and 1 at 5). it comes with the following description: 
Player and skeleton sprites are on a 48x48 grid.
Slime is on a 32x32 grid.

Flip right facing sprites to get the left facing sprites.

Animations [rows (0 based for us programmers)]
Player:
[0 - 2] idle
[3 - 5] move
[6 - 8] attack
[9] death

Enemies:
[0 - 2] idle
[3 - 5] move
[6 - 8] attack
[9 - 11] damaged
[12] death


next the tilesets have these assets (assets/tilesets),(assets/tilesets/floors),(assets/tilesets/floors/walls) ,(assets/tilesets/floors/walls/walls.png) ,(assets/tilesets/floors/walls/wooden_door_b.png) ,(assets/tilesets/floors/walls/wooden_door.png) ,(assets/tilesets/floors/carpet.png) ,(assets/tilesets/floors/flooring.png) ,(assets/tilesets/floors/wooden.png) ,(assets/tilesets/decor_8x8.png) ,(assets/tilesets/decor_16x16.png) ,(assets/tilesets/fences.png) ,(assets/tilesets/grass.png) ,(assets/tilesets/plains.png) ,(assets/tilesets/water_decorations.png) ,(assets/tilesets/water_lillies.png) ,(assets/tilesets/water-sheet.png) ,(assets/tilesets/water1.png) ,(assets/tilesets/water2.png) ,(assets/tilesets/water3.png) ,(assets/tilesets/water4.png) ,(assets/tilesets/water5.png) ,(assets/tilesets/water6.png)

the particles have these assets: (assets/particles),  (assets/particles/dust_particles_01.png)

the objects have these assets: (assets/objects), (assets/objects/chest_01.png), (assets/objects/chest_02.png), (assets/objects/objects.png), (assets/objects/rock_in_water_01-sheet.png), (assets/objects/rock_in_water_01.png), (assets/objects/rock_in_water_02.png), (assets/objects/rock_in_water_03.png), (assets/objects/rock_in_water_04.png) , (assets/objects/rock_in_water_05.png) , (assets/objects/rock_in_water_06.png) , (assets/objects/rock_in_water-sheet.png)

inform how i should structure my github file structure related to this game (the assets folder currently the only one that exists) and implement all of the aspects we have now, using the attack animation for anything that we dont have particular animations for.
